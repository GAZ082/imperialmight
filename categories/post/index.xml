You may very well have a broad picture of the game visiting the &lt;a href=&#34;about-the-game/&#34;&gt;About The Game&lt;/a&gt;. If really interested in the game, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://imperialmight.com/the-imperial-newsletter&#34;&gt;The Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; section so we keep in touch.
