After more than 30 days in lock down, I kept working on the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blog Update III</title><link>https://imperialmight.com/blog-update-iii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:20:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://imperialmight.com/blog-update-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;New year and new post!

Is a never ending game where you interact with fellow Kings using tools related to diplomacy, economy, military and culture.
Your subjects use their free will to move and settle where economic and subsistence opportunities emerge, forming trade routes than then become roads and links to other Kingdoms.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://imperialmight.com/about-me/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:38:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://imperialmight.com/about-me/</guid><description>Hello there. I&amp;rsquo;m Gabriel, a 37 year old guy from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I&amp;rsquo;m a Business Intelligence Analyst, freelance web developer, IT Engineering undergrad and future husband.
I have always dreamed of making a game and developing it as a business and now I&amp;rsquo;m giving it a real shot. I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it my living and if not, at least I&amp;rsquo;ll learn a lot of new things to beef up my resume.</description></item><item><title>Blog Introduction &amp; A Bit Of History</title><link>https://imperialmight.com/blog-introduction-a-bit-of-history/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:33:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://imperialmight.com/blog-introduction-a-bit-of-history/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Imperial Might Development Blog!
