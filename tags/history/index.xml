You may very well have a broad picture of the game visiting the &lt;a href="about-the-game/">About The Game&lt;/a>. If really interested in the game, check out &lt;a href="https://imperialmight.com/the-imperial-newsletter">The Newsletter&lt;/a> section so we keep in touch. In &lt;a href="about-me/">About Me&lt;/a> you will know a little bit about who is behind all this thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a timid first post where I share a little bit of history about how I decided to start the game as a good first post to introduce the blog.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
